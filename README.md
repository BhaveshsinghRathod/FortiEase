This is the 2nd version of my project FortiEase, this project is basically for people who doesn't understand the basics of cryptography and importance of securing thier data.
In this version 1.2, I have added a few features for the user to make it more interactive and easier for them. 
The main feature is complete control by the user. The user gets to choose what he wants to do with FortiEase, he can select if wants to encrypt a new data, decrypt an old data, or view stats and manage his data.
Among the other small features that have been added to the project are: addition of main menu for the user from where he/she can decide what he wants to do further, the user will also get an option if wants to use his/her own key while encrypting the data.
To decrypt the data, the user will now need to know/remember the ID of the data, so that he/she can decrypt the exact data which they want. 
While viewing the data history and encryption history, the user will get to view the ID of the data, the method that was used to encrypt the data, so he/she can easily find which particular data he/she wants to decrypt.
